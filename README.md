DSCI 100 – Project Planning Stage (Individual)

Title: Predicting High-Load Hours on a Minecraft Research Server
Name: Angel (Anjiu Shi)
Student Number: 41909375
Section: DSCI 100

Overview:
This project analyzes player activity on a Minecraft research server to identify high-load time periods.
Using R, I clean, visualize, and model the data to predict when the server is most likely to experience heavy traffic.

Datasets:
players.csv: Player experience, play hours, gender, and age
sessions.csv: Start and end times of each play session

Methods:
Data cleaning and creation of time variables using lubridate and dplyr
Visualization of activity patterns with ggplot2
Logistic regression model to predict high-load hours
